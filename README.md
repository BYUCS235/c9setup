# c9setup
This tutorial will show you how to setup a c9.io workspace for your first lab in CS 235.  You will use the same process to setup the rest of the labs for the class.  We will be using a lot of in-class learning activities and will be using c9 for all of these.  You should set up an account and follow this tutorial even if you are planning to complete your labs using another development environment.
#Creating an account
You should have received an email message telling you that you have been invited to c9.io .  If you did not receive an email message, send email to [Dr. Clement](mailto:clement@cs.byu.edu) to receive an invitation.
