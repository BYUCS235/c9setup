/*
*	This class specifies the methods for a fighter.
*
*	All fighters have the following attributes:
*		Name - The fighter's name
*		Hit Points - The amount of health the fighter has, with a specified maximum; reaching 0 is equivalent to losing. A Fighter's
*			starting Hit Points (which is a Fighter's maximum Hit Points) must be greater than 0. There is no upper bound to what
*			a Fighter's starting/maximum Hit Points could be.
*		Strength - Physical power, used to determine hit point regeneration. Must be greater than 0. No maximum value.
*		Speed - Dexterity and physical movement, used to reduce damage when being attacked. Must be greater than 0. No maximum value.
*		Magic - Magical prowess, used for some special abilities. Must be greater than 0. No maximum value.
*
*	The three fighter types have unique abilities:
*		Robot - Relies on strength to deal damage.  Also can use stored energy to temporarily increase damage (max/starting energy equal to 2*magic).
*			Only Robots have energy.
*		Archer - Relies on speed to deal damage.  Also can increase its speed for the remainder of the battle (no max bonus speed).
*		Cleric - Relies on magic to deal damage.  Also can heal itself using mana, restoring hit points (max/starting mana equal to 5*magic).
*			Only Clerics have mana.
*
*	More details about how stats are used and how abilities work can be found in the comments below.

	*	useAbility()
	*
	*	Attempts to perform a special ability based on the type of fighter.  The
	*	fighter will attempt to use this special ability just prior to attacking
	*	every turn.
	*
	*	Robot: Shockwave Punch
	*	Adds bonus damage to the Robot's next attack (and only its next attack) equal to (strength  * ((current_energy/maximum_energy)^4)).
	*	Can only be used if the Robot has at least [ROBOT_ABILITY_COST] energy.
	*	Decreases the Robot's current energy by [ROBOT_ABILITY_COST] (after calculating the additional damage) when used.
	*		Examples:
	*		strength=20, current_energy=20, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=20
	*		strength=20, current_energy=15, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=6
	*		strength=20, current_energy=10, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=1
	*		strength=20, current_energy=5,  maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=0
	*	Robot Note:
	*	The bonus damage formula should be computed using double arithmetic, and only
	*	the final result should be cast into an integer.
	*
	*	Archer: Quickstep
	*	Increases the Archer's speed by one point each time the ability is used.
	*	This bonus lasts until the reset() method is used.
	*	This ability always works; there is no maximum bonus speed.
	*
	*	Cleric: Healing Light
	*	Increases the Cleric's current hit points by an amount equal to one third of its magic.
	*	Can only be used if the Cleric has at least [CLERIC_ABILITY_COST] mana.
	*	Will be used even if the Cleric's current HP is equal to their maximum HP.
	*	Decreases the Cleric's current mana by [CLERIC_ABILITY_COST] when used.
	*	Cleric Note:
	*	This ability, when successful, must increase the Cleric's current hit points
	*	by at least one, unless doing so would given the Cleric more hit points than its maximum hit points.
	*	Do not allow the current hit points to exceed the maximum hit points.
	*
	*	Return true if the ability was used; false otherwise.
